##Overview.
Welcome to my project-portfolio!
This README file equips you with the essential information about the aim of the website and its features.
In this project I wrote custom CSS and HTML code to design a "pleasing to the eyes" portfolio website. The aim of the <i>project-portfolio</i> was to put my CSS and HTML knowledge into practice to create a portfolio website that is responsive and interactive.
