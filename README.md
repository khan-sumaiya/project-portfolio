## Overview.
Welcome to my [project-portfolio](https://khan-sumaiya.github.io/project-portfolio/)!
This README.txt file equips you with the essential information about the aim, purpose and the features of the website.
In this project I wrote custom CSS and HTML code to design a "pleasing to the eyes" portfolio website. The aim of the project-portfolio was to put my CSS and HTML knowledge into practice to create a portfolio website that is responsive and interactive. Users will be able to view my previous projects.

## Features.
The website comprises of 2 pages: the home page and the form page (through which users can send messages to the developer).

### Home page
#### 1)  navbar
- At the very top of the page, the navbar comprises of links that anchor to different sections of the webpage (home, about, contact and projects). When one of themis clicked, it scrolls down to the corresponding section:

- Following that, the LinkedIn and GitHub icons are links that takes the user to my LinkedIn and GitHub profile:

- The pencil icon anchors the form page, which is separate from the home page:

### 2) banner
- In the banner, there are two buttons and when clicked:
  1) "let's talk" button = takes user to the form page, where they can enter their details and the message.
  2) "see my work" button = page scrolls down to the projects section.
